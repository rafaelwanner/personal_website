Hello I am Rafael and I love to build things.
I am 23 years old and was born, raised and live in beautiful Switzerland.
I am currently studying electrical engineering and information technology at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html). Next to my studies I like to read, do various sports and of course improve my coding skills.
